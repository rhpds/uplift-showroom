= Istio Traffic Management for Virtual Machines

== Introduction

In the world of containers, service mesh (or Isitio more specifically) is considered one of the most desirable and transformational kubernetes features.
Whenever we talk about service mesh, it's in the context of words like *modernized*, *12 factor*, *SOA* and containerized apps - never with legacy virtual machines.

*UpLift and Shift* is about giving additional feature functionality without requiring rewriting or replatforming your applications.

Imagine the situation where a web application is running in Windows IIS and customers are reporting intermittent errors/latency.
What tooling exists for those legacy virtual machines to troubleshoot?

In this final section, we'll show how we can use the advanced network telemetry from Istio and Kiali to easily troubleshoot these issues with our legacy windows virtual machines.

////
== Remove the Service and Route

The Service and Route created in the previous modules are no longer necessary.
Service Mesh will replace these features with a far more robust solution.

CAUTION: Make sure you're in your `windowsmesh-{user}` namespace.

. From the OpenShift Console, on the left, click *Networking -> Services* and delete all the services you find.
. To delete the route, click *Networking -> Routes* and delete all the routes you find.

Now you can proceed to replace these features with the Service Mesh.
////

== Enable Service Mesh in your VMs

. Go to each winweb VM and add the following line to *line 190 in the YAML* as part of the `annotations:` section.
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes",role=execute]
----
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: 'true'
----

. Go to the database VM and add the following line to *line 157 in the YAML*, as part of the `annotations:` section.
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes",role=execute]
----
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: 'true'
----

== Enable Service Mesh in Your Namespace

The administrators have already given your user permissions to activate the service mesh for your namespace.
Ask your instructor if you are interested in learning how this was achieved.

To enable the Service Mesh for your namespace

. *click the Plus sign on the upper right of the OpenShift Console*.
. Paste the following YAML.
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes",role=execute]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMember
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: windowsmesh-{user}
spec:
  controlPlaneRef:
    namespace: istio-system
    name: basic
----
+
. Restart all three your virtual machines to start the Istio side-car container.
.. Click *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and make sure you're in the `windowsmesh-{user}` Project.
.. Use the extended menu on the right side of each virtual machine to *Restart* each of them.
.. To validate that you have the side-car container added, go to *Workload -> Pods*.
You should see the number of containers in the pod is now 2.
The second pod is the Service Mesh side-car pod.

== Prepare Information

You're creating several resources via the GUI:

====
    Route
        (Ingress into the cluster)
        ↓
    Gateway
        (Handles incoming traffic to the mesh)
        ↓
    VirtualService
        (Defines routing rules in the mesh)
        ↓
    DestinationRule
        (Defines traffic policies to the VMs)
====

Prepare to enable your app with service mesh by gathering the following information:

[[getroute]]
=== Get your Route, test your Route

The DestinationRule defines the policy with a number of factors.
DestinationRules have a `host` parameter which identifies the source of the traffic.
We'll use the ingress Route that's already been created for you as that value.

Use the OpenShift console to locate your {user} Route and copy it to use soon in the DestinationRule.

. Click *Networking -> Routes*, make sure that the *Project `istio-system`* is selected.
. Identify your route as matching your user name: `{user}`
. Copy the route location with the copy button.
+
image::module-6-get-route.png[Route,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
. *Click the arrow to browse to the application*.
It should be down, responding with "Application is not available."
This is because there are no services configured for the route to send traffic to.
Instead of setting up a kubernetes service, lets's set up  service mesh!

[[accesskiali]]
== Access Service Mesh UI and Locate resources

=== Access the Service Mesh UI: Kiali

. Log in to the {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Console] via Cogito as `{user}` with password `{password}`.
. Change to the Administrator perspective, in the dropdown on the left.
. To find the Kiali web ui, click *Home -> Projects -> `istio-system`*.
Click the link on the right side *Launcher* *Kiali* image:fa-external-link-alt.png[]
+
image::module-6-kiali-link.png[Kiali route link,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Log in to the {kiali_url}[Kiali web interface^] with your username `{user}` and password `{password}`.
. Within Kiali, click *Services* on the left.
. From the *namespace* drop-down on the top bar, select your namespace: `windowsmesh-{user}`.
. Notice that we have a service called `winmesh`.
+
.Find the `winmesh` istio service
image::module-6-kiali-namespace-services.png[Kiali namespace,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. *Click the `winmesh` service* - notice that there are two *workloads*, which are our virtual machines, `winweb01` and `winweb02`.
Though named similarly, these are different virtual machines from the earlier modules virtual machines.
They have OpenShift Service Mesh enabled, and are in a different project/namespace.

== Create Request Routing for your winmesh Service

CAUTION: This is the complicated part, pay attention.

You will use the web interface to create the service mesh resources to serve up your application.
You'll learn how the resources fit together.

// start do content.mode == workshop/demo here

. In the top right corner, click *Actions* and *Request Routing*
+
.The `winmesh` istio service and components
image::module-6-kiali-service-winmesh.png[winmesh Service,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Click *Route To* and notice the two virtual machines are listed.
. Notice that there's already a *Route Rule* to do 50/50 load balancing.
. *Click Add Route Rule* to add that rule to what will become your VirtualService
. Click *Show Advanced Options* at the bottom.
. *Replace Virtual Service Hosts* by pasting your Route from above.
This will populate a new VirtualService resource with the route to your Virtual Machines.
+
.Request routing
image::module-6-kiali-request-route-virtual-hosts.png[Request Route VirtualHost,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Click *Gateways* and click *Add Gateway*.
. Click *Create Gateway*.
. Paste your Route into *Gateway Hosts* to identify the source of the traffic which the Gateway will direct into the mesh.
. *Remove the `https://` from the Gateway Hosts name*
+
.Service mesh gateways

image::module-6-kiali-create-request-route-gateways.png[Request Route Gateway,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
// end content.mode == workshop/demo here
In the Preview popup window you'll see the DestinationRule, Gateway, and VirtualService.
The DestinationRule indicates which resources will be part of the VirtualService.
The VirtualService indicates what percentage of traffic is routed to each of the destinations.

NOTE: You'll likey have to wait a minute or two for the graph visualization to appear in the *Overview* page.

[[visualizingtraffic]]
== Visualizating Traffic

We've deployed a load-generation tool along side these virtual machines to aide in load visualization.
It provides traffic through your mesh to your application to mimic a live application receiving traffic.
When we finally see this application exposed through the service mesh and Route, we'll see a high visitor count because of the load-generator.

. Click *Graph* on the left side.
. Click the *Display* drop-down box.
.. Tick *Response Time* to see request latency.
.. Tick *Throughput* checkbox to see data transfer rate.
.. Tick *Traffic Distribution* checkbox to view load balancing percentage.
.. Tick *Traffic Rate* checkbox to see how many requests per second are being sent.
.. Tick *Traffic Animation* checkbox to see little dots representing individual requests.
+
.Kiali detailed traffic graph
image::module-6-kiali-graph-setup.png[Kiali Graph Set Up,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Notice the panel on the right side that shows request response code (200, 300, 400, 500s)

Zoom in and out of the graph to see traffic details.

== Verify your application is accessible

Now that the service mesh is set up, we can access the application via the Internet through the Route.

. Paste your application Route into your browser.
. The application should be working, and we have a high number of application

[[congratulations]]
== Congratulations

The Cloud Native features already present in OpenShift provide a far most robust and complete platform than competing platforms.

We hope this workshop has helped you understand the UpLift and Shift vision, and how you can get far more than simple replatforming when your new platform is OpenShift.
